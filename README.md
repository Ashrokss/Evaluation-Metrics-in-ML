# Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning Models

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various evaluation metrics for both classification and regression models. The notebooks provide detailed explanations and code examples to help you understand how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models effectively.

## Notebooks

1. [Classification Evaluation Metrics](Classification_Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb)
    - This notebook covers essential metrics for evaluating classification models, including:
      - Accuracy
      - Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
      - Confusion Matrix

2. [Regression Evaluation Metrics](Regression_Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb)
    - This notebook covers essential metrics for evaluating regression models, including:
      - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
      - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
      - R-squared
      - Adjusted R-squared

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you need to have the following packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`
